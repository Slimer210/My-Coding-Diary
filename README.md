# My Coding Diary
This is just a place for me intended to record my coding skills, projects and also reflect on what I had done. 

As one of the God of procrastination (or God of laziness), this is the place for me to reflect what had I learnt along my coding journey, and also fulfill myself for the future environment.

## What will I record?

This is the following things will be mainly recorded:

- Tech stacks (what things I learnt and how much I knew about it)
- Projects (when I start a project, archive a project, and so on)
- Experiences (work hours, competitions, clients)
- GH contributions (number of contribs, lines in which year)
- Portfolio (history)
- My story (yup just in case we need it)
